                      <p>My given name is Margaret, although I've been Maggie my entire life. As lovely a name as Margaret is, it simply doesn't fit me. As I find myself embarking on this wondrous, yet challenging quest, I 
                        am thrilled to be here. Although I've never played many computer or video games, (read that as statistically none) I've always loved a good intellectual challenge. While I absolutely need 
                        artistic expression and input, I easily excelled at higher level math and science classes. </p>
                      <p>I was diagnosed with ADHD a couple years ago, while dealing an overly stressful and taumatic cluster of time. Understanding why I struggle with certain things allowed me to find healthier 
                        ways to manage those things. It also gave me a chance to look at the big picture and see my strengths more clearly. I have always had a knack for coming up with creative solutions. When it 
                        comes to managing a crisis, I'm a whiz at partitioning and putting my attention on the things I can do something about that will help the situation. I love throwing everything I can at 
                        something and walking away proud of what I accomplished. </p>  
                      <p>I have always prided myself in being "well-rounded". Over the years, I've found joy in tinkering on old volkswagens, cooking, all manner of art, and music. My current hobbies primarily 
                        include knitting and sewing, which I'm using to build a wardrobe which expresses my colorful personality and love of historical fashion aesthetics. I credit my time with my first husband for 
                        broadening my horizons and finding a new way to view the world. I credit the time with my second husband for my two amazing children.</p>
                      <p>In my children, I see my stubborn streak and their own variations of quirky colorfulness. My daughter loves dramatic flourishes and "girly stuff." She's also fascinated by bugs, reptiles, 
                        and all varieties of animal. She brings the color into my world. My son has always been my sunshine, quick with a hug or a smile. Sometimes a little too quick with the hug, invading my 
                        personal space and driving me nutty. He has an insane amount of knowledge about dinosaurs for a 3-year-old. With sunshine and color, what else could I need? </p>
                      <p>My goal in being here, is not only to make a path to something I can love and pride myself in doing, but also to give myself the means to provide a safe place where my kids can follow 
                        their own neurodivergent paths to whomever they choose to be. I can be the best mom I can be by not only not stressing excessively about providing for their base physical needs, but by 
                        modeling my path and lifelong journey to being the best me I can be.</p>
